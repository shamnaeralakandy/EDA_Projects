1.Decoding Mental Health: A Comprehensive Analysis of Contributing Factors
 ◦ Analyzed a mental health dataset to explore the impact of demographic, lifestyle, and psychological factors on
 well-being. Performed EDA, statistical profiling, and visualizations to uncover patterns in variables such as anx
iety, depression, stress, and social support. Extracted insights to support mental health awareness and early
 intervention strategies.
 
 2.Retail Sentiment Tracker for Stock Performance
 ◦ Performed data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail and news sentiment data for major
 U.S. stocks using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly). Analyzed sentiment score distributions, mention
 volumes, and sector-wise sentiment trends. Investigated relationships between sentiment, mentions, returns,
 volatility, and technical indicators (RSI, MACD). Found weak correlation between sentiment and returns, but
 observed higher sentiment scores in stocks with stronger Sharpe ratios, indicating a possible link to risk-adjusted
 performance.
